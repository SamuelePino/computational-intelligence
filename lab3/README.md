# Lab 2: Set Covering with Genetic Algorithm

# Introduction

This lab aims to create various version of an agent able to play Nim:

Task 1: Fixed-Rules
Task 2: Evolvable Agent (EA) [lost files due to wrong versionig]
Task 3: MinMax
Task 4: Reinforcment Learnig (RL)

## Task 1
I implemented a simple agent which counts its own turns, and if the turn is even it will take a single element from the shortes row, otherwise it will take max amount of objects from the longest row

## Task 2

This code has been developed after discussing it with [Marco Prattic√≤ 294815](https://github.com/marcopra). However, our approach and code is different.
